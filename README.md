# _**Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**_

## **Project Description**

* The goal of this project is to  to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify an insect as either a Honey Bee or a Wasp. 

* Insect stings can vary in intensity depending on the insect, and this is largely due to the varying compounds present in their venoms.Scientists have determined that these two insects have different venom chemical compositions, necessitating different antidotes. 

* Additionally, individuals can be allergic to different types of venom, further highlighting the importance of accurately identifying the insect before administering treatment.

* Since Honey Bees and Wasps can look very similar to the naked eye, our CNN model would provide a valuable tool for correctly identifying the insect and selecting the appropriate antidote.

## **Methodology**



## **Model Architecture**

## **Model Evaluation**


## **Analysis**

* To improve the model's accuracy, new data can be artificially generated from existing data through the process of data augmentation.

* Prior to data augmentation, the overall accuracy of the model on the validation set was **0.642.** 

* However, following the implementation of data augmentation, the model's accuracy improved to **0.724** on the validation set.
